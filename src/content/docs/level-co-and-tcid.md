Whenever a TC ID is put into the system a Level 1 is automatically assigned and it can not be changed.  If level CO is still required, it should be added a day after the Level 1 was added.

Also, there must have been some contact with the family to have the information to complete a TC ID form, which is the reason for the automatic Level 1 assignment.  HFA Best Practices state that 2 consistent contacts are generally advised before a case is taken off CO, but as always this falls under best discretion.
