1. Go to Settings Gear Control, next to your Zoho picture, in the top right corner.
2. Under Customization, click on Layouts & Fields
3. Click on CHSR and a 'Ticket Information' layout should appear, starting with Contact Name at the top.
4. Find Program, hover your cursor over the field, and a gear icon should appear.  Click it.
5. Choose "Edit Properties"
6. Hover over an item in the "Pick List Values" and click the + icon that appears.
7. Type in the Product Name <space> ProgramPK <space> Program Name
NOTE: Any special character will fail (commas, pound signs, dollar, etc.)
NOTE 2: No special characters can be in the application program table either, as this is sent to Zoho and matches on the name you added in step 7.
