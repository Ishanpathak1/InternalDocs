PICHC has a two step process for account creation and integration.  First is the part that we handle, which is creating the account itself.  But after that, the Program Manager must go onto the Program Detail page for their program, and create a worker record.  This record features information we aren&#39;t privy to as tech support (though it&#39;s not confidential, it covers things like %FTE funded by PICHC, Hire Date, and Titles and Descriptions), so it&#39;s best to have the Program Manager handle it.  They then need to link the record to the username we created, and then they should be good to go.
