In GitHub\HFNY-CSharp using windows explorer, double-click on the file FilesAheadOfStaging.sh  (it should open a GitBash window and list all the files from all branches ahead of Staging).  Make sure you aren&#39;t stepping on someone else&#39;s toes by checking if a file you&#39;re working on exists in someone else&#39;s branch.
