In GitHub\HFNY-CSharp using windows explorer, double-click on the file FilesAheadOfStaging.sh  (it should open a GitBash window and list all the files from all branches ahead of Staging).  Make sure you aren't stepping on someone else's toes by checking if a file you're working on exists in someone else's branch.
