In the event that a user can not login and can not receive password email changes (e.g. their security system is blocking our emails as spam) follow these procedures.
1. Let the user know that we take security very seriously.
2. Validate the user is who they say they are.  This can be done by sending a direct email to them and asking them to reply or tell you the subject of the email.  A direct email should absolutely get through to the user.
3. Change the user password temporarily, to a simple word (e.g. &quot;PASSWORD&quot;, &quot;ONETIME&quot;).
4. Use the temp password to be absolutely sure it works PRIOR to letting the user know what it is.
5. Tell the user the temp password and tell them to change their password as soon as they get into the application.
6. Let the user know you will attempt to login with the simple temporary password in 90 minutes using their login.  If successful, you will reset the password, locking them out again.  This is to ENSURE they change their password.
7. Do not attempt to login multiple times or you will LOCK the user out.  Copy the temp password to be absolutely sure you have it right.
8. If you are unable to login, you&#39;re done.  If you are able to login, then logout and click on the &quot;Forgot Password&quot; button to reset their password.
