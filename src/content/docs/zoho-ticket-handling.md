Tech Support Policy and Procedure
December 2021


Ticket Handling 
Tech support agents will assign themselves to a ticket prior to responding to a ticket. 
Only the assigned tech support agent or the tech support manager will reassign the ticket to another agent. (If the tech support manager is reassigning the ticket, then the Comment Section will be noted.)
The assigned agent will be the only respondent to the contact. Other agents will utilize the Comment section to discuss ticket content or advise on tickets. 
If the user responds to ticket which is assigned to an agent who is out of the office for more than 3 days, another user can/should respond and close the ticket if appropriate. 
If another person is drafting a response (this message will appear if an agent is responding), discontinue your response and utilize the Comments section if necessary. 
Data requests should first be sent to the IT Manager or a senior programmer for review, to determine how much effort the request involves.  That information will be sent to Kristen Kirkland to help her determine if the data request should be approved, modified, or denied.
